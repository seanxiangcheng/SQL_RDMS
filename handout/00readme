------------

If needed, you can re-create the EMP relation using this command:

    mk-datafile  EMP < emp-data

You can also change the data file 'emp-data' (add more tuples ?) to
create your own test file.

Create the other relations with similar commands.

------------

The file "queries" contains some queries that must pass the test.
